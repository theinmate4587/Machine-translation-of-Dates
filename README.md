# Machine-translation-of-Dates
We use Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model to translate human readable dates ("25th of June, 2009") into machine readable dates ("2009-06-25"). This is done using an attention model, one of the most sophisticated sequence to sequence models.
This was an assignment of Deep learning Course on Coursera.
